Change Log
==========

###### 1.27 - October 16, 2014
Use UTC timezone for all projects by default.

###### 1.26 - October 11, 2014
Move shutdown functionality to a public method.

###### 1.25 - October 9, 2014
Revamp the logging system; current logging levels:  `silent`, `info`, `stack`,
`debug`, `devel`.  Each log level is described in the
[configuration document](/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#confloglevelconf).

Automatically fork into background when in `silent` logging mode; otherwise
`silent` is equivalent to `info`.  On systems that don't support forking (ex. no
PCNTL library), `silent` will default to `info`.

`IPCHandling` related functionality is now conditionally loaded if PCNTL is
available.  Update modules to verify that `function_exists("pcntl_fork")`
evaluates to true before attempting to use `IPCHandling`.

###### 1.24 - October 7, 2014
Rearrange the documentation into the docs/ folder in the project root.

Add some inline documentation to the launcher.

###### 1.23 - September 28, 2014
Add the `getPath()` method to `StorageHandling` to enable fetching a simplified,
correct path to a file or folder.

###### 1.22 - September 19, 2014
Fix a few bugs with the `IPCHandling` class, the `Logger` class, and the
`StorageHandling` class.

###### 1.21 - September 6, 2014
Add inter-process communication handling and modify the rest of the framework to
integrate it.

Update `Logger` to separate multiple lines into multiple `Logger` calls and
right align the log type prefix.

###### 1.20 - August 17, 2014
Deprecate `@@CLASSNAME@@` for better alternative `__CLASSNAME__` that satisfies
code validation and text editor requirements.

Update all core modules to use `__CLASSNAME__`.

###### 1.19 - August 16, 2014
Prevent a module from being unloaded if another module which is unloadable
depends upon it.
