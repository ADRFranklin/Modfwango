===========

#### Creating Your First Module

Each module has a specific set of requirements in order to be compliant with the
`ModuleManagement` class:
* Must be located somewhere inside the `modules` directory in your project root
* Must be inside of a class named `__CLASSNAME__` (or `@@CLASSNAME@@` for
  legacy modules)
* Must have a non-static property `$name` defined as the base filename without
its extension
* Must have a non-static method `isInstantiated` that returns true if the module
decides it wants to be loaded, or otherwise return false
* Must have opening and closing `<?php` `?>` tags surrounding code

Here is an example module that does absolutely nothing except allow itself to be
loaded:
```php
<?php
  class __CLASSNAME__ {
    public $name = "ModuleFileName";

    public function isInstantiated() {
      return true;
    }
  }
?>
```

#### Dependencies
Modules can establish certain dependencies that are required in order for them
to load.  This can be done by defining a class property named `$depend` with a
value of an array with strings of module names.  An example is shown below:
```php
<?php
  class __CLASSNAME__ {
    public $depend = array("ConnectionConnectedEvent",
      "ConnectionDisconnectedEvent");
    public $name = "Example";

    public function isInstantiated() {
      return true;
    }
  }
?>
```

#### Using Available APIs

Modfwango comes packed with some APIs to allow creating modules to be extremely
easy.  Each class with `Management` or `Handling` in the name is a completely
static class.  These APIs consist of:
* `ConnectionManagement`, `Connection` - Allows you to define, undefine,
connect, and disconnect connections
* `EventHandling` - Allows you to create, preprocess, and register for events
* `Logger` - Allows you to easily log information in various categories
* `ModuleManagement` - Allows you to control which modules are loaded at any
given time
* `SocketManagement`, `Socket` - Allows you to define and undefine server
sockets that will accept client connections
* `StorageHandling` - Allows you to create, delete, write, and read files
through a simple interface

Let's go over each API, shall we?

##### ConnectionManagement
`ConnectionManagement` allows you to control incoming or outgoing connections.
`ConnectionManagement` has the following available methods:
* `bool newConnection(Connection $connection)` - Adds a connection to the
connection manager
* `mixed getConnectionByHost(String $host)` - Returns a connection that has the
provided host, or returns false
* `mixed getConnectionByIndex(int $index)` - Returns a connection that has the
provided index, or returns false
* `bool delConnectionByHost(String $host)` - Removes a connection that has the
provided host, or returns false
* `bool delConnectionByIndex(int $index)` - Removes a connection that has the
provided index, or returns false
* `mixed getConnectionIndexByHost(String $host)` - Returns the index of a
connection that has the provided host, or returns false
* `array getConnections()` - Returns an array of all connections known by
the connection manager
* `bool loadConnectionFile(String $file, bool $autoconnect)` - Returns true upon
successful loading of a connection configuration file, or false on failure.
Auto-connects to the connection if specified

Since `ConnectionManagement` is responsible for managing `Connection` classes,
we'll cover those next.

##### Connection
The `Connection` constructor method is structured as so:
```
bool __construct(String $type, array $data)
```
`Connection` accepts two parameters:
* The type of connection (`"0"` for outgoing, `"1"` for incoming)
* The associated data array

Currently the data array should contain the following parameters for outgoing
connections:
* A string of the target hostname
* A string/int of the target port
* A bool of whether or not SSL should be used
* [Optional] An array of options

The data array should be structured as so for outgoing connections (the last
key is optional):
```
array(
  0 => "hostname.example.org",
  1 => "1337",
  2 => true,
  3 => array(
    "optional" => "setting",
    "other" => "setting1"
  )
)
```

Currently the data array should contain the following parameters for incoming
connections:
* The socket
* A string/int of the target port
* A bool of whether or not SSL should be used
* [Optional] An array of options

The data array should be structured as so for incoming connections (the last
key is optional):
```
array(
  0 => $socket,
  1 => 1337,
  2 => false,
  3 => array(
    "optional" => "setting",
    "other" => "setting1"
  )
)
```

And finally, a new connection should be created as so:
```
$connection = new Connection("0", array("example.org", 1337, false, array()));
```

###### Methods

After a connection has been created, you can use the following available
methods:
* `bool configured()` - Returns whether or not the `Connection` was properly
configured
* `bool connect()` - Attempts to connect to the specified host/port, returns
true if successful, returns false upon error or if `$type` is `"1"`
* `bool disconnect()` - Disconnects from the socket, returns true if successful,
returns false if socket property is not a valid resource
* `mixed getData()` - Retrieves data from the socket, returns a string on
success, or false on failure
* `String getConnectionString()` - Returns a string describing the connection
* `String getHost()` - Returns the hostname of the remote connection endpoint
* `String getIP()` - Returns the IP of the remote connection endpoint
* `String getLocalHost()` - Returns the hostname of the local connection
endpoint
* `String getLocalIP()` - Returns the IP of the local connection endpoint
* `mixed getOption(String $key)` - Returns the value of option by `$key`,
returns false if it doesn't exist
* `mixed getPort()` - Returns string/int of connection port
* `bool getSSL()` - Returns true if using SSL, false if using plaintext
* `String getType()` - Returns `"0"` if outgoing connection, returns `"1"` if
incoming connection
* `bool isAlive()` - Returns true if socket is a resource, false if it isn't
* `bool send(String $data, bool $newline = true)` - Returns true on successful
data transmission, false on failure
* `bool setOption(String $key, String $value)` - Sets option by `$key` to
`$value`, always returns true

##### EventHandling
`EventHandling` is essentially the core idea of the Modfwango project.  The
`EventHandling` class encompasses the majority of how functionality is usually
implemented through modules.  Basically, when Modfwango receives data from any
given `Connection` class, it triggers the `EventHandling::receiveData()` method
which gives modules that provide events the opportunity to trigger themselves
for each of their registrations.  This allows you to make events that trigger
automatically, for example, when a certain string of data is sent, or if certain
conditions are met.  An event module can be as simple as shown below:
```php
<?php
  class __CLASSNAME__ {
    public $name = "ConnectionConnectedEvent";

    public function isInstantiated() {
      EventHandling::createEvent("connectionConnectedEvent", $this);
      return true;
    }
  }
?>
```

The above event registers itself as a module by the name of
`ConnectionConnectedEvent` and creates an event called `connectionCreatedEvent`.
This event requires manual triggering since it doesn't register a data
preprocessor callback (the third parameter to `EventHandling::createEvent()`).
An example of an event that includes a data preprocessor is shown below:
```php
<?php
  class __CLASSNAME__ {
    public $name = "RawEvent";

    public function preprocessEvent($name, $registrations, $connection, $data) {
      $ex = explode(" ", $data);

      // Iterate through each registration
      foreach ($registrations as $id => $registration) {
        // Trigger the event for a certain registration
        EventHandling::triggerEvent($name, $id, array($connection, $data, $ex));
      }
    }

    public function isInstantiated() {
      // Create an event for raw data
      EventHandling::createEvent("rawEvent", $this, "preprocessEvent");
      return true;
    }
  }
?>
```

The above event registers itself as a module by the name of `RawEvent` and
creates an event called `rawEvent`.  This event is triggered any time data is
received. This can be useful in very few cases, but it's useful nonetheless.

###### registerForEvent

A module can register for an event by calling
`bool EventHandling::registerForEvent(String $name, Object $module,
String $callback, mixed $data = null)`.  This method will return true if the
registration was successful, or false if it didn't succeed.  An example module
that registers for an event is shown below:
```php
<?php
  class __CLASSNAME__ {
    public $depend = array("RawEvent");
    public $name = "DataLogging";

    public function receiveRaw($name, $data) {
      $connection = $data[0];
      $data = $data[1];

      Logger::info("Data received from ".$connection->getConnectionString().
        ":  \"".$data."\"");
    }

    public function isInstantiated() {
      EventHandling::registerForEvent("rawEvent", $this, "receiveRaw");
      return true;
    }
  }
?>
```

This module registers for the `rawEvent` previously shown.  Any time that data
is received, this module's `receiveRaw` method is called.  Each event
registration must have a callback that conforms to the protocol
`callback(String $name, mixed $data)`.  This ensures that your event
registration is called appropriately.  `$name` provides you with the event name
so that you can register more than one event to the same callback, and `$data`
provides you with something that each specific event thinks is important for you
to have.  This item will vary for each event.

###### registerAsEventPreprocessor

A module can register as an event preprocessor by calling
`bool EventHandling::registerAsEventPreprocessor(String $name, Object $module,
String $callback)`.  This method will return true if the registration was
successful, or false if it didn't succeed.  Registering as an event preprocessor
gives your module the opportunity to alter the event, or outright refuse the
event to trigger.  An example module that registers as an event preprocessor is
shown below:
```php
<?php
  class __CLASSNAME__ {
    public $depend = array();
    public $name = "IgnoreConnectionConnectedEvent";

    public function receiveConnectionConnected($name, $id, $data) {
      return array(false);
    }

    public function isInstantiated() {
      EventHandling::registerAsEventPreprocessor("connectionConnectedEvent",
        $this, "receiveConnectionConnected");
      return true;
    }
  }
?>
```

This module registers as a preprocessor for the `connectionConnectedEvent`.  Any
time that the `connectionConnectedEvent` attempts to trigger, this module's
`receiveConnectionConnected` method is called.  Each event preprocessor
registration must have a callback that conforms to the protocol
`callback(String $name, int $id, mixed $data)`.  This ensures that your event
preprocessor registration is called appropriately.  `$name` provides you with
the event name so that you can register more than one preproocessor to the same
callback, `$id` provides you with the specific registration ID, and `$data`
provides you with something that each specific event thinks is important for you
to have.  This item will vary for each event.

When preprocessing an event, `EventHandling` looks for two things:
* Your return value must be an array or it is ignored
* Your return value must be equal to `array(false)` or
`array(null, mixed $data)` before any action is taken (`array(true)` is just
ignored since it would be considered a successful preprocessor passthrough)

There are two types of return values that alter the event's state:
* `array(null, mixed $data)` - Tells `EventHandling` that you desire to replace
the previous `$data` with a new value
* `array(false)` - Tells `EventHandling` that the event should be cancelled

###### Methods

A full list of methods for the `EventHandling` class is listed below:
* `bool function createEvent(String $name, Object $module,
String $callback = null)` - Allows you to create an event named `$name` with an
origin from your `$module`, with an optional callback of `$callback` to
preprocess data.  Returns true on successful creation, false upon failure
* `bool function destroyEvent(String $name)` - Removes an event named `$name`,
returns true if successful, false if the event didn't exist
* `mixed function getEventByName(String $name)` - Returns an event with the
specified `$name`, or false if the event didn't exist
* `array function getEvents()` - Returns an array of all events
* `bool function receiveData(Connection $connection, String $data)` - Allows you
to simulate incoming `$data` from a specified `$connection`
* `bool function registerForEvent(String $name, Object $module,
String $callback, mixed $data = null)` - Allows you to register a `$callback` in
your `$module` for the event with specified `$name`.  You can optionally include
data to the event's data preprocessor if it exists through the `$data` variable.
Returns true if registration successful, false if an error occured
* `bool function registerAsEventPreprocessor(String $name,
Object $module, String $callback)` - Allows you to register a `$callback` in
your `$module` for the event with specified `$name`
* `bool function triggerEvent(String $name, int $id,
mixed $data = null)` - Triggers a specific registration of `$id` for event named
`$name` with optional `$data`
* `bool function unregisterEvent(Object $module)` - Unregisters all events for
given `$module`
* `bool function unregisterForEvent(String $name, Object $module)` - Unregisters
`$module` for event named `$name`
* `bool function unregisterPreprocessorForEvent(String $name,
Object $module)` - Unregisters `$module` for event named `$name` as preprocessor
* `bool function unregisterModule(Object $module)` - Unregisters `$module` for
all event registrations and preprocessors

##### IPCHandling
`IPCHandling` allows you to dispatch a method into a new background thread and
receive a callback in the main thread when processing is complete.

Methods destined for background processing will require one parameter for an
optional passthrough of job specific data.  Callbacks will require two
parameters; the first for the thread UUID, the second for the return value of
the dispatched method.  An example module is shown below:

```php
<?php
  class __CLASSNAME__ {
    public $name = "Test";
    public $depend = array("ConnectionCreatedEvent", "RawEvent");

    public function receiveConnectionCreated($name, $data) {
      Logger::debug("Test::receiveConnectionCreated");
      // Spawn a background thread when a new connection is created
      $uuid = IPCHandling::dispatch($this, "testIPCMethod",
        "testIPCMethodCallback", rand(5, 10));
      Logger::debug("Thread UUID:  ".$uuid);
      return true;
    }

    public function testIPCMethod($data) {
      // This is the method that will be dispatched into the background
      Logger::debug("Test::testIPCMethod");
      $ret = null;
      for ($i = 0; $i < $data; $i++) {
        sleep(1);
        $ret .= "Hello";
      }
      return $ret;
    }

    public function testIPCMethodCallback($uuid, $data) {
      // This method will be called when the dispatched method has finished
      Logger::debug("Test::testIPCMethodCallback");
      Logger::debug($uuid);
      Logger::debug(var_export($data, true));
    }

    public function isInstantiated() {
      EventHandling::registerForEvent("connectionCreatedEvent", $this,
        "receiveConnectionCreated");
      return true;
    }
  }
?>
```

In the above example, when a connection is established to the framework, an
event is fired that causes the `testIPCMethod` method to be dispatched into a
new background thread.  After it returns a value, the `testIPCMethodCallback`
method will be called with the return value of the dispatched method.

The only useful method for this class is shown below:
* `string dispatch(Object $module, String $method, String $callback,
  mixed $data = null)` - Spawns a new thread and calls the specified `$method`
  owned by `$module`.

##### Logger

The `Logger` class allows you to easily categorize logging that you might want
to (and probably should) incorporate into your modules.  `Logger` has four
static methods that you might be interested in:  `Logger::info`,
`Logger::stack`, `Logger::debug`, and `Logger::devel`.  Each method is listed in
descending order in terms of log severity and accepts a string as its only
parameter.  More details about each log level can be found
[here](/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#confloglevelconf).

*Note:  When entering other modules, it would be to your advantage to include
stack logging to be able to backtrace crashes.*

##### ModuleManagement
`ModuleManagement` enables you to control the current set of loaded modules.  A
list of methods for this class is shown below:
* `bool isLoaded(String $name)` - Returns true if a module with the given
`$name` is loaded, otherwise returns false
* `array getLoadedModules()` - Returns an array of all loaded module objects
* `array getLoadedModuleNames()` - Returns an array of names of all loaded
modules
* `mixed getModuleByName(String $name)` - Returns a module object with the given
`$name` if loaded, otherwise returns false
* `mixed loadModule(String $name, bool $suppressNotice = false)` - Returns true
if a module with the given `$name` can be loaded, null if the module cannot be
loaded because of missing dependencies, or false upon failure.  An optional
`$suppressNotice` flag can be set to true to hide the logging for the method
* `bool reloadModule(String $name)` - Simply calls `unloadModule` and
`loadModule` and returns true if both are successful, otherwise returns false
* `bool unloadModule(String $name, bool $suppressNotice = false)` - Unloads a
module with the given `$name` and returns true upon success, or false upon
failure.  Also includes the optional `$suppressNotice` variable to hide logging

##### SocketManagement
`SocketManagement` allows you to control server sockets that accept clients.
`SocketManagement` has the following available methods:
* `bool newSocket(Socket $socket)` - Adds a socket to the socket manager
* `mixed getSocketByHost(String $host)` - Returns a socket that has the provided
host, or returns false
* `mixed getSocketByIndex(int $index)` - Returns a socket that has the provided
index, or returns false
* `bool delSocketByHost(String $host)` - Removes a socket that has the provided
host, or returns false
* `bool delSocketByIndex(int $index)` - Removes a socket that has the provided
index, or returns false
* `mixed getSocketIndexByHost(String $host)` - Returns the index of a socket
that has the provided host, or returns false
* `array getSockets()` - Returns an array of all sockets known by the socket
manager

##### Socket
The `Socket` constructor method is structured as so:
```
bool __construct(String $host, mixed $port)
```

`Socket` accepts two parameters:
* A hostname or IP address bind string
* A string/int of the port to listen on

A listening socket should be created as so:
```
$socket = new Socket("0.0.0.0", 1337);
```

###### Methods
After a socket has been created, you can use the following available methods:
* `bool configured()` - Returns whether or not the `Socket` was properly
configured
* `bool close()` - Closes the socket, always returns true
* `String getHost()` - Returns the bind hostname
* `mixed getPort()` - Returns the bind port
* `String getSocketString()` - Returns a string describing the socket
* `bool accept()` - Attempts to accept a new client and add it to the
`ConnectionManager`.  Returns true if a client was accepted, otherwise false

##### StorageHandling
`StorageHandling` is a class that promotes hassle free management of storage.  A
list of available methods is shown below:
* `bool createDirectory(Object $module, String $name)` - Creates a directory
named `$name` in the given `$module`'s sandbox, returns true on success, or
false on error
* `mixed loadFile(Object $module, String $name)` - Returns the contents of a
file with given `$name` in the given `$module`'s sandbox, or false upon error
* `bool saveFile(Object $module, String $name, String $contents)` - Saves a
file named `$name` with given `$contents` in the specified `$module`'s sandbox
