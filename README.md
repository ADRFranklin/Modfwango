Modfwango
=========

Modfwango is a modular socket framework written in PHP.  This framework has been
refined over the past few years for personal use, and I decided to make it open
to the public.  It is stable, clean, modular, and object oriented.  This
particular repo stemmed from the
[IRCBot-PHP](https://github.com/ClayFreeman/IRCBot-PHP) framework, formerly
known as Modfwango.  I decided to make the separation, because a networking
framework with reloadable modules is of more use to people than just a simple
IRC bot.

Install
=======

This framework is tested under Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS X.  Windows compatibility
is unknown, and probably unstable.  To use this framework, make sure that you
have the latest version of PHP 5 CLI installed on your machine.

In order to setup a Modfwango-based project, decide on a project name, then run
the following commands:
```
mkdir ProjectName && cd ProjectName
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/ClayFreeman/Modfwango.git .modfwango
cp .modfwango/launcher.php .
php launcher.php
```

Those commands will initialize a git repository, add Modfwango as a submodule,
provide you with a launcher for your project, and create a base directory/file
structure.

Update
======

In order to update Modfwango, a file called `update.sh` should have been placed
into your project's root directory.  Simply run `sh update.sh` to update
Modfwango.

Configuration
=============
To configure Modfwango, follow these simple guidelines:

#### conf/listen.conf
If you require a socket server to listen for connections, you need to configure
this file.  The syntax for this file is the listen address, followed by a comma,
followed by the port you'd like to listen on.  Multiple entries should each be
on a line by themselves.  An example configuration is shown below.
```
0.0.0.0,1337
127.0.0.1,1338
```

#### conf/modules.conf
This file is likely to be required by everyone; if you intend on implementing
custom functionality in your project, you need to do it with a module.  This
file allows for modules to be auto-loaded at runtime.  Each module should be on
its own line, and should be named relative to the `modules` directory inside of
your project's root folder.  Modules should not include the `.php` file
extension.  Modules can be nested in an infinite amount of folders.  An example
configuration file is shown below.  Order doesn't matter; modules will be loaded
after all of their dependencies have been loaded.
```
events/ConnectionConnectedEvent
events/ConnectionCreatedEvent
events/ConnectionDisconnectedEvent
events/ConnectionLoopEndEvent
events/RawEvent

libraries/Timer
```

#### conf/connections/<name>.conf
If you need to connect to other servers, you need to create a file for each
connection.  Each file is parsed with the built-in PHP INI file parser.  An
example file with all parameters is shown below.  You can optionally include the
`[options]` block, which will be available for use during runtime.
```
address = "example.org"
port = 1337
ssl = false

[options]
param1 = "hello"
param2 = "world"
```

Development
===========

#### Creating Your First Module

Each module has a specific set of requirements in order to be compliant with the
`ModuleManagement` class:
* Must be located somewhere inside the `modules` directory in your project root
* Must be inside of a class named `@@CLASSNAME@@`
* Must have a non-static property `$name` defined as the base filename without
its extension
* Must have a non-static method `isInstantiated` that returns true if the module
decides it want's to be loaded, or otherwise return false
* Must have opening and closing `<?php` `?>` tags surrounding code

Here is an example module that does absolutely nothing except allow itself to be
loaded:
```php
<?php
  class @@CLASSNAME@@ {
    public $name = "ModuleFileName";

    public function isInstantiated() {
      return true;
    }
  }
?>
```

#### Using Available APIs

Modfwango comes packed with some available APIs to allow creating modules to be
extremely easy.  A list of these are:
* `ConnectionManagement`, `Connection` - Allows you to define, undefine,
connect, and disconnect connections.
* `EventHandling` - Allows you to create, preprocess, and register for events
* `ModuleManagement` - Allows you to control which modules are loaded at any
given time
* `SocketManagement`, `Socket` - Allows you to define and undefine server
sockets that will accept client connections.
* `StorageHandling` - Allows you to create, delete, write, and read files
through a simple interface.

Let's go over each API, shall we?

###### ConnectionManagement
`ConnectionManagement` has the following available methods:
* `bool newConnection(Connection $connection)` - Adds a connection to the
connection manager
* `mixed getConnectionByHost(String $host)` - Returns a connection that has the
provided host, or returns false
* `mixed getConnectionByIndex(int $index)` - Returns a connection that has the
provided index, or returns false
* `bool delConnectionByHost(String $host)` - Removes a connection that has the
provided host, or returns false
* `bool delConnectionByIndex(int $index)` - Removes a connection that has the
provided index, or returns false
* `mixed getConnectionIndexByHost(String $host)` - Returns the index of a
connection that has the provided host, or returns false
* `array getConnections()` - Returns an array of all connections known by
the connection manager
* `bool loadConnectionFile(String $file, bool $autoconnect)` - Returns true upon
successful loading of a connection configuration file, or false on failure.
Auto-connects to the connection if specified

Since `ConnectionManagement` is responsible for managing `Connection` classes,
we'll cover those next.

###### Connection
The `Connection` constructor method is structured as so:
```php
bool __construct(String $type, array $data)
```
`Connection` accepts two parameters:
* The type of connection (`"0"` for outgoing, `"1"` for incoming)
* The associated data array

Currently the data array should contain the following parameters for outgoing
connections:
* A string of the target hostname
* A string/int of the target port
* A bool of whether or not SSL should be used
* [Optional] An array of options

The data array should be structured as so for outgoing connections (the last
key is optional):
```php
array(
  0 => "hostname.example.org",
  1 => "1337",
  2 => true,
  3 => array(
    "optional" => "setting",
    "other" => "setting1"
  )
)
```

Currently the data array should contain the following parameters for incoming
connections:
* The socket
* A string/int of the target port
* A bool of whether or not SSL should be used
* [Optional] An array of options

The data array should be structured as so for incoming connections (the last
key is optional):
```php
array(
  0 => $socket,
  1 => "1337",
  2 => false,
  3 => array(
    "optional" => "setting",
    "other" => "setting1"
  )
)
```

And finally, a new connection should be created as so:
```php
$connection = new Connection("0", array("example.org", 1337, false, array()));
```

After a connection has been created, you can use the following available
methods:
* `bool configured()` - Returns whether or not the `Connection` was properly
configured
* `bool connect()` - Attempts to connect to the specified host/port, returns
true if successful, returns false upon error or if `$type` is "1"
* `bool disconnect()` - Disconnects from the socket, returns true if successful,
returns false if socket property is not a valid resource
* `mixed getData()` - Retrieves data from the socket, returns
* `String getConnectionString()` - Returns a string describing the connection
* `String getHost()` - Returns the hostname of the remote connection endpoint
* `String getIP()` - Returns the IP of the remote connection endpoint
* `String getLocalHost()` - Returns the hostname of the local connection
endpoint
* `String getLocalIP()` - Returns the IP of the local connection endpoint
* `mixed getOption(String $key)` - Returns the value of option by `$key`,
returns false if it doesn't exist
* `mixed getPort()` - Returns string/int of connection port
* `bool getSSL()` - Returns true if using SSL, false if using plaintext
* `String getType()` - Returns "0" if outgoing connection, returns "1" if
incoming connection
* `bool isAlive()` - Returns true if socket is a resource, false if it isn't
* `bool send(String $data, bool $newline = true)` - Returns true on successful
data transmission, false on failure
* `bool setOption(String $key, String $value)` - Sets option by `$key` to
`$value`, always returns true

###### EventHandling
I'll document `EventHandling` tomorrow.
