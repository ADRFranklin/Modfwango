Modfwango
=========
***

Modfwango-Client is a modular client socket framework written in PHP.  This
framework has been refined over the past two years for personal use, and I have
just recently decided to make it open to the public.  This framework has been
used by me almost every day for the past couple of years.  It is stable, clean,
modular, and object oriented.  This particular repo stemmed from the IRCBot-PHP
framework, formerly known as Modfwango.  I decided to make the separation,
because a networking framework with reloadable modules is of more use to more
people than just an IRC bot.


Install
=======
***

This framework was tested under Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS X.  Windows
compatibility is unknown, and probably unstable.  To use this framework, make
sure that you have the latest version of PHP 5 CLI installed on your machine.
Configuration for this framework is inside the configuration directory `conf/`.
After you are done configuring it, just run the main file with `php main.php`
and the application will start.  You can put this into a screen just by doing
`screen php main.php`.


Development
===========
***

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/ClayFreeman/Modfwango-Client/wiki) for
