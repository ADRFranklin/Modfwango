Modfwango
=========

Modfwango (pronounced `mahd-fuƒÅn-gogh`) is a modular socket framework written in
PHP.  This framework has been refined over the past few years for personal use,
and I decided to make it open to the public.  It is stable, clean, modular, and
object oriented.  This particular repo stemmed from the
[IRCBot-PHP](https://github.com/Modfwango/IRCBot-PHP) framework, formerly known
as Modfwango.  I decided to make the separation, because a networking framework
with reloadable modules is of more use to people than just a simple IRC bot.
