![Modfwango](http://dpr.clayfreeman.com/zarH+ "Modfwango")

Modfwango is a modular socket framework written in PHP.  This framework has been
refined over the past few years for personal use, and I decided to make it open
to the public.  It is stable, clean, modular, and object oriented.  This
particular repo stemmed from the
[IRCBot-PHP](https://github.com/Modfwango/IRCBot-PHP) framework, formerly
known as Modfwango.  I decided to make the separation, because a networking
framework with reloadable modules is of more use to people than just a simple
IRC bot.
