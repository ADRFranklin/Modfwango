Modfwango (pronounced `mahd-fuƒÅn-gogh`) is a modular socket framework written in
PHP.  This framework has been refined over the past few years for personal use,
and I decided to make it open to the public.  It is stable, clean, modular, and
object oriented.  This particular repo stemmed from the
[IRCBot-PHP](https://github.com/Modfwango/IRCBot-PHP) framework, formerly known
as Modfwango.  I decided to make the separation, because a networking framework
with reloadable modules is of more use to people than just a simple IRC bot.

Objective
=========

Normally in PHP, classes cannot be redefined.  This limits you as a developer
because you don't have the ability to change code on-the-fly and reload it.
Modfwango solves this problem by creating randomly generated class names for
each module, every time it's loaded.  After a module is loaded, it's kept in an
array internal to the `ModuleManagement` class.  You can then decide when to
load and unload modules at will, and `ModuleManagement` will simply either
append or truncate your module from its internal array of loaded modules.
